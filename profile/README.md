# zkHumans

Zero-Knowledge Self-Sovereign Crypto-Biometric Decentralized Identity and
Authentication/Authorization Platform for Modern Humans as Individuals and
Collectives.

The zkHumans Platform facilitates robust fail-safe biometric ownership of one
or more digital identifiers by a unique living human without revealing,
storing, or transmitting Personal Identifiable Information (PII). Identity for
individuals extends to collective identity whereby humans may prove inclusion
(or exclusion) as a member of a group, without revealing which human. A dynamic
protocol and set of utilities facilitates advanced digital Authentication and
Authorization using Multi-Dimensional Authentication Factors.

With properties of Sybil-Resistance and Proof of Living Human, zkHumans enables
definitive connectivity of digital ownership and activity, including within
organizations, to a unique individual human by means of their biometrics while
protecting identity and organizational liability with the highest degrees of
security and privacy.
